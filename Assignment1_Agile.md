## Introduction
Companies today focus on delivering quality and gaining customer satisfaction and in order to accomplish this , the challenge lies in choosing between traditional development methodologies and agile development methodologies. Though its imperative to know that both of these approaches have positives and negatives , making the right choice between plays a crucial role while starting a new project. 

The general points to consider when selecting are 
1. Business Need : Impact of Implementing specified requirements , on customer's business.
2. Customer Perception : Customer perspective of business impact.
3. Project Timeframe : Defined timeframe for the real time implementation of the project.

## General Overviews
### Traditional Project Development
Traditional software development methodologies are based on pre organized phases or stages in the software development cycle. The flow of development is unidirectional , from requirements to design to development to testing and finally maintenence. 
The model uses a linear approach , where the stages of the software development process must be completed in a sequential order. This means that a stage must be completed before the next one begins.
Following are the stages that the model goes through
	1. Requirements gathering and documentation.
	2. System Design
	3. Code and Unit Testing
	4. System Testing
	5. User acceptance testing
	6. Bug Fixes
	7. Product Delivery

For example : In the waterfall model , each phase has specific deliverables and detailed documentation that have undergone a thorough review process.

### Agile Software Development 
Agile approach to software development are precise and extremely customer friendly. Users/Customers have the oppertunity to make modifications through project development phases.  
The approach is an iterative and team based approach. Its main objective is to quickly deliver the application with complete and functional components. Instead of completing the software development tasks in sequence, they are completed in sprints that run from around one to four weeks and where a list of deliverables is completed in each sprint.
The tasks that do not get completed within the sprint are then reprioritized and included in future sprints. This also means that the different stages of the software development life cycle can be revisited as needed.
The approach goes through the following stages:
	1. Project Inititation
	2. Sprint Planning
	3. Demos

For example : As mentioned in the previous paragraph , that traditional software development methodologies have a unidirectional development process, where a set of requirements are estabalished, they cannot be changed later on. Agile voids this concept and chooses to go with the concept that yes requirements are established in advance but they can be modified at any time of the development cycle.

Analysis
1.	Project Complexity
	Traditional development methods are best fit for small or less complex projects as it follows a linear approach. Sudden changes in the project or any other complexities can block the entire process and force the team to go back to step one and start all over again.
	Agile on the other hand is best for complex projects. A complex project may have various interconnected phases and each stage may be dependent on many other rather than a single one as in simple projects. So , Agile methods are preferred for large and complex projects.

   2.	Adaptability
	Traditional approach works with a belief that once a phase is done, it will not be reviewed again. So, it is not adaptable to rapid changes in the work plan. If any unexpected requirement arises or any variation is needed, the traditional approach fails to adapt to new changes. The only choice is to start from the vey beginning once again. This wastes a lot of effort and time in the process.
	Adaptability factor is very high in Agile methadology since it is not liner. Complex projects consist of several interconnected stages, where a change in one stage can cause an effect on another. Project managers can take calculated risks in such scenarios , as there is a chance of high adaptability.

   3.  Scope for feedback and changes
	In traditional methadologies, each and every process is clearly detailed and defined at the start of the project in the traditional approach. It cannot deal with any big change or feedback that might require a change in the process. Mostly, the project delivery time and budget are fixed and allow change very rarely.
	Agile methadologies has a high acceptance for feedback and change in this method. The process is very flexible and allows constant feedback that can help provide a better output within the fixed project delivery time. Developers working with Agile management are able to respond to customer requests quickly as they are only addressing small parts of the project at a time and the customer validates each iteration or sprint before finalizing.

  4.  Customer Engagement/Involvement
	In traditional development methadologies , customer feedback is taken into consideration after the product is released. The customer feedback is implemented either during maintenence , or in the redevelopment of the project.

	In Agile , customer engagement is at the very top. The customer is regarded highly in its frameworks as after every iteration , feedback is generated and acted upon. 

Choosing a software development methodology
A lot of factors come into play when selecting a software development methadology , following are the factors that are taken into consideration.
	The requirements for the project
	Each software development project consists of requirements that must be met before it’s implemented. So, you have to evaluate these requirements and compare them to what you have in place in your company, before choosing a methodology. That way, you’ll be able to arrive at the best methodology to use at all times and choose a system that will give you the best results for the resources and time spent.
	The expected end product of the project: 
	Before starting a software development project, you need to have an end product in mind. This is the result that you hope to achieve after completing the project. You must envision this and sketch it out in the software design phase before the first line of code is written.
	The past experience of the project team with the methodology:
	The experience of the software development team in your company matters too. This should be considered when deciding on the software development methodology you want to use. Some team members may not feel comfortable working with certain systems if they don’t have any prior experience with them, while others might find it difficult getting used to working with new team members. It’s important to keep team capabilities and team dynamics in mind.
	Feedback on the work done:
	Feedback is a crucial aspect of software development. It helps you formulate outcomes for future projects. As a matter of fact, if you don’t know exactly how you arrived at previous results, you won’t be able to replicate them. While doing this, you need to consider how efficient your team is in providing feedback. This depends largely on the applications, methodologies, and the size of the project.
	Project size: 
	Before picking a software development methodology to use, you need to consider the size of the project you’re embarking on. While larger projects may not fit perfectly for the waterfall, some apps will require longer testing times owing to their size and requirements.


Real Life Example : 
Consider a moderate size software project which involves the development of a digital commodity store like games  or softwares such as Steam , Epic Games Store. These stores typicallly have a high speed storage server , a web service to handle monetary transaction and a software client for the customers.
This project's success or failure is heavily dependent on regular customer feedback and the organization ability to maintain the project based on said feedbacks. 

Considering all the points made in the previous paragraphs and the differences highlighted between traditional and agile development model. Only the agile model is flexible enough to take into consideration customer feedback and changing the project's requirements during the software development phase or even in the maintainence phase as well.
